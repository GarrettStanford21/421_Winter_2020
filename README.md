# Econ 421 Lab Notes - Winter Term 2020

This site is for Ed Rubin's 421 Winter 2020 class. Links for lab notes, homework help, and other useful resources can be found below. This site is intended as a complement to attending class and labs, NOT a substitute. If there are any errors or you don't understand something please contact me (gos@uoregon.edu).

## Lab Notes
*Note*:The Lab Notes Posted will be the full version of what I intended to cover in class and may not look exactly the same as the rscript we do together---a further motivation to attend the lab! Occasionally challenge questions will be at the end of the file so you can practice some of your skills.

* __Lab 1: [Introduction](http://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/568277)__
  + In Week 1 I (tried) to cover R basics. This included basic math operations, functions, installing and loading packages, and the dplyr package. Remember everything in R is an object! 

* __Lab 2: [Review, Data, and Regressions](http://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/568257)__
  + In Week 2 we reviewed important concepts from week 1, learned how to run regressions, and to load data into R. 
  
* __Lab 3: [ggplot!](https://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/572127)__
  + In Week 3 we did an introduction to the ggplot package and practiced plotting data

* __Lab 4: [Heteroskedasticity](https://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/572138)__
  + In Week 4 we discussed heteroskedasticity, how to test for it, and how to work around it
  
* __Lab 5: [Functions and Time-Series](https://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/576815)__
  + In Week 5 we began learning how to use functions in R and made a data generating process to create time-series data
  
##Homework Help
* __Problem Set 1 Help:__ [Code](http://rpubs.com/jputz/568130)
   * Compiled by the one and only Jenni Putz! This code that will be useful for completing problem set 1. The assignment and dataset are available on the course Canvas page.

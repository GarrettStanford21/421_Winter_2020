# Econ 421 Lab Notes - Winter Term 2020

This site is for Ed Rubin's 421 Winter 2020 class. Links for lab notes, homework help, and other useful resources can be found below. This site is intended as a complement to attending class and labs, NOT a substitute. If there are any errors or you don't understand something please contact me (gos@uoregon.edu).

## Lab Notes
*Note:The Lab Notes Posted will be the full version of what I intended to cover in class and may not look exactly the same as the rscript we do together -- a further motivation to attend the lab!*

This site is for Ed Rubin's 421 Winter 2020 class. Links for lab notes, homework help, and other useful resources can be found below. This site is intended as a complement to attending class and labs, NOT a substitute. If there are any errors or you don't understand something please contact me (gos@uoregon.edu).

## Lab Notes
*Note*:The Lab Notes Posted will be the full version of what I intended to cover in class and may not look exactly the same as the rscript we do together---a further motivation to attend the lab! Occasionally challenge questions will be at the end of the file so you can practice some of your skills.

* __Lab 1: [Introduction](http://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/568277)__
  + In Week 1 I (tried) to cover R basics. This included basic math operations, functions, installing and loading packages, and the dplyr package. Remember everything in R is an object! 

* __Lab 2: [Review, Data, and Regressions](http://rpubs.com/GarrettStanford21/568257)__
  + In Week 2 we reviewed important concepts from week 1, learned how to run regressions, and to load data into R. 

##Homework Help
* __Problem Set 1 Help:__ [Code](http://rpubs.com/jputz/568130)
   * Compiled by the one and only Jenni Putz! This code that will be useful for completing problem set 1. The assignment and dataset are available on the course Canvas page.
